= Active Record Rack Status

Lightweight Rack Middleware for testing active record connections

== Installation

  gem install rack-active_record_status

== Basic Usage

  require 'rack/active_record_status'
  use Rack::ActiveRecordStatus

Or, if you are using Bundler, just add this to your Gemfile:

  gem 'rack-active_record_status', :require => 'rack/active_record_status'

To use Rack::ActiveRecordStatus in your Rails application, add the following line to your application
config file (<tt>config/application.rb</tt> for Rails 3, <tt>config/environment.rb</tt> for Rails 2):

  config.middleware.use Rack::ActiveRecordStatus

Test your ActiveRecord connection by hitting

  /active_record_status

Anything other than a 200 OK HTTP response code is an error.
