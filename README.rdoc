= App Rack Status

Lightweight Rack Middleware for testing the app status with support for multiple sensors like ActiveRecord

== Installation

  gem install rack-app_status

== Basic Usage

  require 'rack/app_status'
  use Rack::AppStatus

Or, if you are using Bundler, just add this to your Gemfile:

  gem 'rack-app_status', :require => 'rack/app_status'

To use Rack::AppStatus in your Rails application, add the following line to your application
config file (<tt>config/application.rb</tt> for Rails 3, <tt>config/environment.rb</tt> for Rails 2):

  config.middleware.use Rack::AppStatus

  # In older Rails, like 2.3.4, defer loading using a string:
  config.middleware.use "Rack::AppStatus"

Test your ActiveRecord connection by hitting

  GET /app_status

Anything other than a 200 OK HTTP response code is an error.

== Configuration

Use the `:path` option to configure what patht eh middleware responds to.
Use the `:response` option to change the default response.
Use the `:sensors` option to pass an array of symbols to indicate what sensors are to be used.

  config.middleware.use Rack::AppStatus, :path => '/custom_path' # Respond on /custom_path
  config.middleware.use Rack::AppStatus, :response => "I'm alive!" # A different response
  config.middleware.use Rack::AppStatus, :sensors => [:simple, :active_record] # Use simple and ActiveRecord sensor

For rails apps, a useful response is the REVISION file created by deployment tools (like Capistrano).

  revision = Rails.root.join('REVISION').read rescue $!.to_s
  config.middleware.use Rack::AppStatus, :response => revision
